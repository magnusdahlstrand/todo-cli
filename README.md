# TODO-CLI

Uploaded with a [permissive (MIT) license](LICENSE.md) after being left offline in its current state for more than a year.

## What is it?

A Command Line Tool that uses git to manage TODOs in a folder named `.todo` alongside your `.git`-folder. TODO messages are stored as commit messages (!?) in branches named afte unicode signs (☐☑) with a Command Line Interface that thinks differently.

### How?

[The code is short](todo) and hopefully simple to understand

## How to use

Install git and bash (probably recent versions of both), and symlink (or move) the todo file to somewhere in your $PATH.

## Is there a future for this project?

Hadn't thought of one until now. Maybe a convention for how TODOs could ("should") be stored? But if so, please make sure to not store it as commit messages, which is just stupid (as well as the result of me wanting to use git for "everything").

## Does it work?

Mostly. Don't think ticking off old TODOs work, but I've got TODOs to sort it out...
